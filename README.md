Multidimensional Calculators:

These python scripts demonstrate the validity of a new kind of math that scales values relative to their dimensional flux, as measured from naturally occuring nuclear reactions recorded at the Oklo reactor site.

This repo includes the following scripts (all scripts in beta but core functionality is working):

8D Circle (8D circle 3.py):
  - models the effect of time compression of higher dimensional expressions of a base frequency (1D) as it travels through multi dimensional space, creating the illusion of independent movement

Multidimensional Calculator (multidimensional calculator.py):
  - shows the equivalent values, sums, differences, and phase angle path of any two values in any dimension with adjustable spectral path. Defaults to pi @ 3d,3d

Orb Generator (orb generator.py):
  - outputs multidimensional hypersphere to blender file 

Elemental Explorer (elements 1.16.42.py):
  - shows the relative position of other elements to oxygen based on their resonant frequency and density
  - only 31 elements added so far
  - phase offsets could be refined for higher resolution

Solar Simulation (solar simulation.py):
  - simulates the orbits and starting positions of our solar system
  - changing origin point simulates planetary perspective
  - origin points like 6,1 and 7,1 boost detection of planets with earth-like phases, suggesting that the sum of two observations of distant solar systems may reveal more inner planets, and that heavy outer planets act as a cosmic camoflauge that prevent inner planet detection

currently these scripts are just a proof of concept but the math used for the dimensional scaling proves that evolutionary pathways begin in lower dimensional expressions and grow outward like a seed until their internal phase reinforcement creates a high enough signal to cause 8th dimensional peturbations that drive evolution. so in a sense we are evolving because we have always been evolving from our base elements, and the third dimension is just one stop in a multidimensional evolutionary chain.

it is my hope that someone else's perpspective will reinforce this idea and illuminate the path to a higher dimensional existance.
